# Fake News Detector

## Overview

The Fake News Detector is an open-source project aimed at identifying and classifying news articles as either genuine or potentially fake. In today's world of information overload, distinguishing fact from fiction is an increasingly critical task. This project leverages machine learning techniques to help users make more informed decisions about the news they consume.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: The project employs machine learning models for text classification, enabling the detection of potentially deceptive news articles.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: It offers a user-friendly web interface where users can input news articles and receive instant feedback on their authenticity.

- **Robust Dataset**: The models are trained on a diverse and extensive dataset of news articles from various sources, making them adaptable to a wide range of content.

- **Regular Updates**: The project is continually evolving, with ongoing efforts to improve accuracy and expand the dataset.
